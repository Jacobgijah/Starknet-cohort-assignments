# What is Starknet?
Starknet is a technology developed by StarkWare, a blockchain scalability solutions provider. It is designed to improve the scalability, privacy, and security of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain.

Starknet, as a Layer-2 scalability solution for Ethereum, provides quick, secure, and low-cost transactions.

## Technologies Starknet leverage for scalability, privacy, and security
1. Scalability: Starknet leverages a technique called zero-knowledge proofs, specifically "STARKs" (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge). These proofs enable the validation of large batches of transactions off-chain, reducing the burden on the Ethereum mainnet. By processing multiple transactions together, Starknet significantly improves the overall scalability of dApps, allowing them to handle more users and transactions efficiently.

2. Security: Starknet's security is strengthened by the underlying zero-knowledge proofs. These cryptographic proofs ensure the validity of computations without revealing any sensitive data, making it extremely difficult for anyone to cheat the system or manipulate transactions. This enhances the trustworthiness and integrity of the dApps built on Starknet.
