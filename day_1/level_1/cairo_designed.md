# Purpose for designing Cairo
Cairo is a language for writing general-purpose, STARK-provable applications.

Cairo powers Starknet and StarkEx, scaling dYdX, Sorare, ImmutableX, and other Mainnet apps. Starknet, a permissionless decentralized Validity-Rollup, uses Cairo as its native smart contract language.

## What makes its processor unique is
Cairo stands out because its programs can be proved. Programs that can be demonstrated by mathematical arguments are known as provable programs.
